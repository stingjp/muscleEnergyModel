TODO
Welk010 welknatural trial01 - try simulating with no initial guess, or just a different initial guess, to see if it has something to do with that trajectory handling?
	- possibly some spline issue
	- possibly my trimming issue
	- possibly something with the solution I am using being solved at different mesh size
	- ???
	


Also added some weights for specific coordinates, the difference in cost function looks to be around 4.6 compared to 3.6, so that is cool. Not huge, but potentially powerful?? check the final!

con is the convergence tolerance value. J the cost function. all the same mesh and constraint tolerance. 
100 con J = 12.598, , kinematics = decent (slight hip shift forward)
10 con J = 12.598, , kinematics = same ^
1 con J = 12.598, , kinematics = same ^
0.1 con J = 12.598, , kinematics = same ^
0.01 con J = 12.51, , kinematics = same ^
0.001 con J = 12.46, , kinematics = same ^, honestly maybe better
0.0001 con J = didn't converge...
