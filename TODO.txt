figure out doit

want a task that will cycle through all the subjects and run the analysis in some type of way that will allow user to specify which ones they actually want run - semi specifically. 

##
seeing what including the passive fiber forces does to the results of the sims


4. scale goal - slack message has new
5. smooth grf
6. run demb noload studies
7. figure out muscle masses -> utilities.py has stuff on muscle masses and setting up probes! may be incorrect masses - although if they are all referencing the same mass, then wouldn't it be a smaller cost???


TODO:
- update the rest of the subject models (rra mods)
- run the rest of them
- explore results and validation for the subject one sims of all the new sims

TODO
X- welk001 update the exo and check on the masses
X- sim welk001 all new constraint 0.15
X- welk002 all update, masses and exo
X- welk003 update mass/exo/etc

07022021
X- check/v&v welk001 sims (Xvideos, passive force, active force, fiber stuff, activity, kinematic matching) -- some potential mesh artifacts at the beginning, recfem issues possibly
- try one sim at higher mesh density (0.05 ~ 3 hrs, 0.01 ~ ?)
- try one sim with higher effort weight
- run welk002 sims
- run welk003 sims
- welk004 figure out the issue with RRA
