% This example features two different tracking problems solved using the
% MocoTrack tool. 
%  - The first problem demonstrates the basic usage of the tool interface
%    to solve a torque-driven marker tracking problem. 
%  - The second problem shows how to customize a muscle-driven state tracking 
%    problem using more advanced features of the tool interface.
%
% This example also shows how to use the osimMocoTrajectoryReport.m utility to
% create a PDF report of plots of a solution.
%
% See the README.txt next to this file for more information.

% Solve the torque-driven marker tracking problem.
% This problem takes a few minutes to solve.

% Solve the muscle-driven state tracking problem.
% This problem could take an hour or more to solve, depending on the number of
% processor cores available for parallelization. With 12 cores, it takes around
% 25 minutes.
